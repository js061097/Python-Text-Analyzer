I someday wanna create a unique virtual assistants with features never seen
before. One of the idea I have in mind is to bring some human emotion prediction.
Does our brain operate in a particular way emotionally? Are there any patterns
to it? I know emotions are something that can be controlled by one but I also
know that we react with emotions differently given particular circumstances.
Maybe the assistant can identify that? For example videos that I watch or 
based on the words that I speak (sentiment analysis?) or the words that others
use about me? Can it detect that and tell me not to feel that way emotionally,
giving me ideas to divert from that and focus on positives if I'm about to 
show negative emotions. Also think about the positives... What if it detects
I'm going into a really happy state and it promotes it. One funny thought I
have right now is: take for example someone's high, can it elate the mood by
provide cool songs based on what they've taken in and the environment. Man 
that would be epic. Imagine how people doing it for recreational purposes 
feel. I don't know if it'll work but it's just a thought that I had. I need to
study, work hard, believe that someway this will work and go ahead with it.
Hey atleast there's nothing wrong in trying than learning a lot right?
Also, I probably should research about that emotional pattern or detection 
stuff. Adios!
